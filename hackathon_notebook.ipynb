            "Flake8 is a fantastic tool for enforcing code style and detecting errors in Python code. Its extensibility through plugins is one of its greatest strengths. Here are some popular and highly recommended Flake8 plugins, categorized for clarity:\n",
            "\n",
            "**General Code Quality & Style:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **flake8-bugbear:** (B901-B950)  This is a *must-have*.  It catches a wide range of common bugs and anti-patterns that are often missed by other linters.  It's very opinionated and often suggests improvements that lead to more robust and readable code.  Examples include:\n",
            "    *   Unnecessary `else` after `return`\n",
            "    *   Using `isinstance` with a tuple of types (suggests using `isinstance(x, (type1, type2))`)\n",
            "    *   Using `len(x) == 0` instead of `not x`\n",
            "    *   Using `try...except...pass` (which is almost always a bad idea)\n",
            "*   **flake8-comprehensions:** (C400-C419)  Suggests using list/set/dict comprehensions instead of loops or `map`/`filter` when appropriate.  This can significantly improve code readability and sometimes performance.\n",
            "*   **flake8-annotations:** (ANN001-ANN999) Enforces type annotations (PEP 484) on function arguments and return values.  This is crucial for static analysis and improving code maintainability.  It can be configured to be more or less strict.\n",
            "*   **flake8-docstrings:** (D100-D499)  Checks for the presence and style of docstrings.  Helps ensure that your code is well-documented.  Can be configured to enforce specific docstring formats (e.g., Google, NumPy, reStructuredText).\n",
            "*   **flake8-eradicate:** (E271, E272)  Finds commented-out code.  Commented-out code often becomes stale and misleading, so removing it improves code clarity.\n",
            "*   **flake8-print:** (T201, T203)  Detects `print` statements in your code.  `print` statements are often left in by accident during debugging and should be removed before committing.\n",
            "*   **flake8-logging-format:** (G001-G010)  Checks that logging format strings use the correct style (e.g., `%s` vs. `{}`, and that the number of arguments matches the number of placeholders).  Helps prevent logging errors.\n",
            "*   **flake8-blind-except:** (B001)  Detects bare `except:` clauses, which can mask important exceptions and make debugging difficult.  Encourages you to catch specific exceptions.\n",
            "*   **flake8-builtins:** (A001-A003)  Detects shadowing of built-in names (e.g., using `list` as a variable name).  Shadowing built-ins can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
            "*   **flake8-mutable-defaults:** (B006)  Detects mutable default arguments in function definitions (e.g., `def foo(x=[]):`).  Mutable defaults are a common source of bugs.\n",
            "*   **flake8-return:** (RET501-RET508)  Checks for consistent return statements in functions.  For example, it can ensure that all return statements in a function return a value, or that a function always returns a value.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Security:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **flake8-bandit:**  Integrates Bandit, a security linter, into Flake8.  Bandit identifies potential security vulnerabilities in your code, such as using insecure functions or hardcoding secrets.  This is *essential* for any project that handles sensitive data or interacts with external systems.\n",
            "*   **flake8-import-restrictions:** (I100-I999)  Allows you to restrict which modules can be imported in certain parts of your codebase.  This can be useful for enforcing architectural constraints or preventing the use of deprecated modules.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Complexity & Maintainability:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **flake8-cognitive-complexity:** (C101-C103)  Calculates the cognitive complexity of functions and methods.  High cognitive complexity indicates that a function is difficult to understand and maintain.  This plugin encourages you to refactor complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
            "*   **flake8-simplify:** (SIM100-SIM910)  Suggests ways to simplify your code, making it more readable and maintainable.  Examples include:\n",
            "    *   Replacing `if x is True` with `if x`\n",
            "    *   Using `any()` or `all()` instead of loops\n",
            "    *   Simplifying boolean expressions\n",
            "\n",
            "**Formatting & Style (Beyond PEP 8):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **flake8-quotes:** (Q000-Q004)  Enforces consistent use of single or double quotes.  While PEP 8 doesn't mandate a specific quote style, consistency is important for readability.\n",
            "*   **flake8-commas:** (C812, C813)  Enforces trailing commas in function calls, list/tuple/dict definitions, etc.  Trailing commas can make diffs cleaner and prevent errors when adding new elements.\n",
            "*   **flake8-rst-docstrings:** (RST301-RST399)  Validates reStructuredText docstrings.  Ensures that your docstrings are properly formatted and can be rendered correctly by documentation generators like Sphinx.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Testing:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **flake8-pytest-style:** (PT001-PT021)  Enforces best practices for writing pytest tests.  For example, it can suggest using `assert` instead of `assertTrue` or `assertFalse`, and using `pytest.mark.parametrize` for parameterized tests.\n",
            "\n",
            "**How to Choose Plugins:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Consider your project's needs:**  What are the most important aspects of code quality for your project?  Security?  Readability?  Maintainability?  Choose plugins that address those needs.\n",
            "2.  **Start with the essentials:**  `flake8-bugbear`, `flake8-comprehensions`, `flake8-annotations`, and `flake8-docstrings` are a good starting point for most projects.\n",
            "3.  **Be mindful of configuration:**  Many plugins have configuration options that allow you to customize their behavior.  Read the documentation for each plugin to understand how to configure it to meet your specific requirements.\n",
            "4.  **Don't overdo it:**  Too many plugins can lead to a noisy and overwhelming linting experience.  Start with a few essential plugins and add more as needed.\n",
            "5.  **Iterate and refine:**  As your project evolves, you may need to add or remove plugins, or adjust their configuration.  Regularly review your Flake8 configuration to ensure that it is still meeting your needs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Installation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "You can install Flake8 plugins using `pip`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```bash\n",
            "pip install flake8 flake8-bugbear flake8-comprehensions flake8-annotations  # Example\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "**Configuration:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Flake8 plugins are typically configured in a `setup.cfg`, `.flake8`, or `pyproject.toml` file.  For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```ini\n",
            "# setup.cfg\n",

            "\n",

            "Summary: Amsterdam ( AM-stər-dam, UK also  AM-stər-DAM; Dutch: [ˌɑmstərˈdɑm] ; lit. 'Dam in the Amstel') is the capital and most populated city of the Netherlands. It has a population of 933,680 in June 2024 within the city proper, 1,457,018 in the urban area and 2,480,394 in the metropolitan area. Located in the Dutch province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the \"Venice of the North\", for its large number of canals, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n",
            "Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Amstel River, which was dammed to control flooding. Originally a small fishing village in the 12th century, Amsterdam became a major world port during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, when the Netherlands was an economic powerhouse. Amsterdam was the leading centre for finance and trade, as well as a hub of secular art production. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded and new neighborhoods and suburbs were built. The city has a long tradition of openness, liberalism, and tolerance. Cycling is key to the city's modern character, and there are numerous biking paths and lanes spread throughout.\n",
            "Amsterdam's main attractions include its historic canals; the Rijksmuseum, the state museum with Dutch Golden Age art; the Van Gogh Museum; the Dam Square, where the Royal Palace of Amsterdam and former city hall are located; the Amsterdam Museum; Stedelijk Museum, with modern art; the Concertgebouw concert hall; the Anne Frank House; the Scheepvaartmuseum, the Natura Artis Magistra; Hortus Botanicus, NEMO, the red-light district and cannabis coffee shops. The city is known for its nightlife and festival activity, with several nightclubs among the world's most famous. Its artistic heritage, canals, and narrow canal houses with gabled façades, well-preserved legacies of the city's 17th-century Golden Age, have attracted millions of visitors annually.\n",
            "The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, is considered the oldest \"modern\" securities market stock exchange in the world. As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an  alpha-world city. The city is the cultural capital of the Netherlands. Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters in the city. Many of the world's largest companies are based here or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as technology companies Uber, Netflix, and Tesla. In 2022, Amsterdam was ranked the ninth-best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit and 12th on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. The city was ranked 4th place globally as a top tech hub in 2019. The Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe. The KLM hub and Amsterdam's main airport, Schiphol, is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, third in Europe, and 11th in the world. The Dutch capital is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with about 180 nationalities represented. Immigration and ethnic segregation in Amsterdam is a current issue.\n",
            "Amsterdam's notable residents throughout its history include painters Rembrandt and Vincent van Gogh, 17th-century philosophers Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, René Descartes, and the Holocaust victim and diarist Anne Frank.\n"

            "Summary: Amsterdam ( AM-stər-dam, UK also  AM-stər-DAM; Dutch: [ˌɑmstərˈdɑm] ; lit. 'Dam in the Amstel') is the capital and most populated city of the Netherlands. It has a population of 933,680 in June 2024 within the city proper, 1,457,018 in the urban area and 2,480,394 in the metropolitan area. Located in the Dutch province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the \"Venice of the North\", for its large number of canals, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n",
            "Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Amstel River, which was dammed to control flooding. Originally a small fishing village in the 12th century, Amsterdam became a major world port during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, when the Netherlands was an economic powerhouse. Amsterdam was the leading centre for finance and trade, as well as a hub of secular art production. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded and new neighborhoods and suburbs were built. The city has a long tradition of openness, liberalism, and tolerance. Cycling is key to the city's modern character, and there are numerous biking paths and lanes spread throughout.\n",
            "Amsterdam's main attractions include its historic canals; the Rijksmuseum, the state museum with Dutch Golden Age art; the Van Gogh Museum; the Dam Square, where the Royal Palace of Amsterdam and former city hall are located; the Amsterdam Museum; Stedelijk Museum, with modern art; the Concertgebouw concert hall; the Anne Frank House; the Scheepvaartmuseum, the Natura Artis Magistra; Hortus Botanicus, NEMO, the red-light district and cannabis coffee shops. The city is known for its nightlife and festival activity, with several nightclubs among the world's most famous. Its artistic heritage, canals, and narrow canal houses with gabled façades, well-preserved legacies of the city's 17th-century Golden Age, have attracted millions of visitors annually.\n",
            "The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, is considered the oldest \"modern\" securities market stock exchange in the world. As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an  alpha-world city. The city is the cultural capital of the Netherlands. Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters in the city. Many of the world's largest companies are based here or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as technology companies Uber, Netflix, and Tesla. In 2022, Amsterdam was ranked the ninth-best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit and 12th on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. The city was ranked 4th place globally as a top tech hub in 2019. The Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe. The KLM hub and Amsterdam's main airport, Schiphol, is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, third in Europe, and 11th in the world. The Dutch capital is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with about 180 nationalities represented. Immigration and ethnic segregation in Amsterdam is a current issue.\n",

            "Summary: Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the \"King of Pop\", he is regarded as one of the most significant figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his world record music achievements broke racial barriers in America and made him a global figure. Through songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for artists in popular music; popularizing street dance moves including the moonwalk (which he named), the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is often deemed the greatest entertainer of all time based on his acclaim and records.\n",
            "The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his public debut in 1964 at age six, as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). After signing with Motown in 1968, the band achieved worldwide success with him as its lead singer. Jackson achieved solo stardom with the release of his fifth album Off the Wall (1979). He followed it up with Thriller (1982), the best-selling album of all time, which propelled him to the forefront of pop culture and revolutionized the music video medium with the videos for its title track along with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\". Jackson furthered his position as a global superstar with Bad (1987), the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Bad\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", \"Man in the Mirror\", and \"Dirty Diana\". Dangerous (1991) marked a new era for Jackson, lauded as his most artistic and socially conscious album. HIStory (1995) produced \"You Are Not Alone\", the first song to debut at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, as well as the protest songs \"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\". His final album, Invincible, was released in 2001.\n",
            "From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. He was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend in 1993. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and all other charges. While preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died in 2009 from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. His televised memorial service, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people. \n",
            "Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 500 million records worldwide. He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (the fourth-highest in Hot 100 history) and is the first artist to have a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame (making him the only recording artist to be inducted). As one of the most-awarded artists in popular music, he received 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards, including the Artist of the Century and Artist of the 1980s, six Brit Awards, three presidential honors including Artist of the Decade, the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award, and 12 World Music Awards including the Millennium Award, among other awards. In 1992, Jackson founded Heal the World Foundation, donating an estimated $500 million to charity throughout his lifetime. In 2024, half of his music catalogue sold to Sony for $600 million, the largest music acquisition for a single artist in history.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mMichael Joseph Jackson (1958-2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist, dubbed the \"King of Pop.\" He is regarded as one of the most significant figures of the 20th century and broke racial barriers in America.
